        red uniform @talkingmouth "Hey, red."

        silver @angrybrow talking2mouth "What the hell do you want?"

        pause 1.0

        silver @sadbrow talking2mouth "Sorry, red."

        red @sadbrow talkingmouth "I know you're working on it."
        red @happy "Anyway, when we were talking with [duplica_name], you mentioned there had been a few Rocket resurrection attempts."

        silver @talking2mouth "Too many, but keep your voice down. It's damn impossible to hear anything in this cafeteria, but we don't want to be careless."

        red @sadbrow talkingmouth "{size=30}Right.{/size} What can you tell me about them? There were four, right?"

        silver @closedbrow talking2mouth "Yeah."

        silver @talking2mouth "The first was Team Neo Rocket. If any attempt was going to succeed, it would've been them. After Kanto's Rocket disbanded, a bunch of the guys in Johto refused to believe it."
        silver @sadbrow talkingmouth "They thought Giovanni was being... {i}coerced{/i}, or it was a false flag, or something. They took a bunch of guys, the ones left over, recruited some of the Rockets left in Kanto, and tried to take over Johto."
        silver @closedbrow talking2mouth "In all fairness to them, they {i}did{/i} manage to take over the Goldenrod Radio Tower. They broadcast a nationwide announcement saying they'd taken over Johto for Giovanni, and asked him to come back."

        pause 2.0

        red @talking2mouth "I guess he didn't."

        silver @sadbrow talkingmouth "All that just to place a phone call that wasn't picked up."

        red @confused "Why did they need {i}him{/i}, though? Why not just... run the region themselves?"

        silver "[ellipses]"
        silver @talking2mouth "It's like I said with The Copycat. Rocket is {i}defined{/i} by its lack of imagination. All they can think of doing is the same thing they've always done. Steal. Hurt. Profit."
        silver @sadbrow talking2mouth "Without a strong leader like Giovanni[ellipses] they have no direction."

        pause 1.0

        silver @closedbrow talking2mouth "Well, enough direction to take over a region, but not enough to do anything with it once they did."

        pause 2.0

        silver @talking2mouth "Anyway, that was the only revival attempt that might have, in some alternate universe, succeeded. Everything else was just... dumb as hell."

        pause 1.0

        silver @closedbrow talking2mouth "Team GO Rocket thought that there was some kind of special 'Shadow' Pokémon out there that could give them the strength they needed to come back." 
        silver @talking2mouth "They went to Orre, looking for these Pokémon, met up with another group of criminals--Silence, or something--and[ellipses] disappeared. We lost contact with them. Guess {i}someone{/i} stopped 'em."

        pause 1.0

        silver @closedbrow talking2mouth "Team Great Rocket is when we started getting {i}really{/i} pathetic about it. They took over a small island West of Galar. Holed up in an old castle there." 
        silver @talkingmouth "An international card game tournament was in the area, and they intended to use those high-level players as hostages while they built up money and manpower."
        silver @sadbrow talkingmouth "Turns out being a goddamn nerd doesn't mean you're weak. The players fought off Team Great Rocket. When one of their executives turned out to be a mole, that was the last straw, and the 'King' of Great Rocket surrendered." 
        silver @talkingmouth "Guess the players enjoyed themselves--they hold 'mock invasion' events every couple years. Visited a couple times. Picked up a bit of an accent."

        red @sadbrowt talkingmouth "And... Rainbow Rocket?"

        silver @angrybrow "[ellipses]"
        silver @talking2mouth "I should find this one funny, but I don't."
        silver @angrybrow talking2mouth "Someone pretending to be Giovanni showed up on TV, claiming he and his 'Team Rainbow Rocket' were now in possession of the Aether Foundation facility."

        pause 1.0

        silver @sadbrow talking2mouth "'Course, that was the last thing we heard from him. The news said that he and his executives--a bunch of schizophrenics who thought they were famous criminals--were beaten by a champion-level trainer and arrested."

        red @surprised "Woah! Who was that trainer?"

        silver @closedbrow talking2mouth "Beats me. Beats Alola, too, I guess, because they started the Alolan league just six months later. Guess they realized couldn't rely on a mysterious 'somebody' dropping in to save them next time."

        red @sadbrow talkingmouth "Well[ellipses] if Team Rainbow Rocket was just a bunch of crazy people, does that count as a {i}real{/i} revival attempt?"

        silver @talking2mouth "It did for the grunts who left to follow that fake Giovanni. I lost a lot of guys to that impostor."

        pause 1.0

        silver @closedbrow talking2mouth "Anyway, you get why I say that {i}any{/i} attempt to bring back Rocket is going to fail, right?"

        red @sadbrow talkingmouth "Hearing your reasoning... yeah, it's pretty impossible to argue with."

        silver @talking2mouth "[ellipses]Yeah."

        pause 0.5

        silver @sadbrow talking2mouth "But a lot of people still do."

        silver @closedbrow talkingmouth "Thanks for not saying it's my destiny, or my duty, to try again, or whatever."

        red @confused "What? I'd never say that."

        silver @talkingmouth "Yeah, and that makes you different."
        silver @talking2mouth "Which, uh, I appreciate."

        red @happy "Buddy? Raise your standards. Right now, they're underground."
