alder @talkingmouth "Good morning, everyone!"
alder @happy2 "You're all looking young and fresh."
alder @closedbrow talkingmouth "I have to be honest, I was pretty sore after that battle we pulled on Friday. I'm not as young as I used to be."

bruno @sad "[ellipses]"

alder @surprised2 "Oh, don't worry about me, Bruno! I'm not about to fall over."
alder @happy2 "If anything, that's proof that I'm in the right place for where I am right now, teaching the kids who'll be the next wave of champions."
alder @talkingmouth "Although I'm pretty sure Champion Blanc is going to hold onto Unova for a long, {i}long{/i}, time."

bruno @norm4 "Not if Benga has anything to say about it."

alder @closedbrow talkingmouth "Ah, now, {i}that's{/i} a firebrand. Benga. He's {i}so{/i} much like me at his age."

bruno @norm2 "He has a strong sense of justice."

alder @closedbrow talking2mouth "Too strong, maybe. But I can't hold that against him. Like I said--when I was his age..."

red uniform @closedbrow talking2mouth "Hm... Benga? Name doesn't ring a bell."

raihan uniform @talkingmouth "Alder's Grandson. Heard he's on the warpath, ever since Blanc snagged the championship."

alder @happy2 "Can't deny that. He really thought {i}he{/i} was going to be the one to beat me, and take the champion title from his own grandpa, keeping it in the lineage."
alder @sadbrow talkingmouth "But champions aren't kings. The strongest gets the title, not the grandkid of the current guy."
alder @happy2 "Besides, I'm sure Benga'll make my daughter proud of him one way or another. I'm already proud of him, and I'd still be proud of him if he never once picked up a Poké Ball."

bruno @norm2 "Youth is a precious gift. I hope all of you are taking advantage of yours."

alder @talkingmouth "Bruno's very right. Take it from a guy who's getting up there."

pause 1.0

alder @happy2 "But enough of life lessons and my family, unless anyone wants to see pictures. I've got a fold-out in my wallet...?"

bruno @happy2 "I may suggest we move onto the battles now."

alder @sadbrow talkingmouth "Worth a shot."
alder @talking2mouth "We're going back to basics with this week. You know what that means--single battles. One-on-one, one student against another."

bruno @norm2 "I will call out the matches."

alder @talkingmouth "And I'm going to call my family, and see how they're doing! You've got this class covered, right, Bruno?"

bruno @happy2 "They are paying you too much for how seriously you take this job."

alder happy @happy2 "And they're not paying {i}you{/i} enough for how seriously you take it!"

bruno @norm2 "Perhaps. I'll take that anecdote to my next salary renegotiation."

bruno @norm4 "Now, it's time to assign your opponents. [first_name], please battle Dawn."
