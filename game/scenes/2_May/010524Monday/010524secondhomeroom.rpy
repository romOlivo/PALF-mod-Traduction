oak @talkingmouth "One often wants their coverage moves to cover a wide array of possible opposing types, hitting as many Pokémon for at least neutral damage as possible."
oak @talkingmouth "Electric and Ice, and Ground and Rock, are particularly reliable combinations, as exemplified through the combinations of Thunderbolt and Ice Beam, and Earthquake and Stone Edge, respectively."
oak @talkingmouth "Another technique that cannot be ignored when speaking of coverage moves is Hidden Power. Being a move learnable by almost every Pokémon, it is also a move that can be any type."

oak @closedbrow sweat talking2mouth "Curiously, a Fairy-typed Hidden Power has not been able to manifest in some regions... but in Kobukan, it's been observed commonly. Frankly, we're not sure why."
oak @talking2mouth "There are theories that Hidden Power draws its power from the 'Hidden Legends' of a region, or Pokémon of immense power that watch over and guard the various regions." 
oak @closedbrow talkingmouth "There simply aren't many Fairy-type Legendary Pokémon to be found in other regions, perhaps explaining why these 'Hidden Powers' are unable to be drawn from."
oak @closedbrow talking2mouth sweat "This theory somewhat breaks down when one considers Kalos, though..."

oak @talking2mouth "[bluecolor]Every opponent will have the ability 'Wonder Guard', instead of whatever abilities they would normally have.{/color} As a reminder, Wonder Guard prevents non super-effective damage from directly-damaging moves."
oak @talkingmouth "The second thing is that it does not matter if your Pokémon faint, as long as you have one Pokémon left standing at the end."
oak @closedbrow talking2mouth "Of course, that's only true in hypothetical essay battles such as this--such a philosophy would be looked on with some concern by Instructor Karen, if you were to try it in a {i}real{/i} battle."

brawly @talkingmouth "Last year, I shared one class with Melody. Just one. We didn't homeroom together, but we had an elective together."
brawly @talkingmouth "We were taking Instructor Juan's elective."

sonia @confused "Oh, yes, I remember Instructor Juan!"

raihan @talking2mouth "...Not ringing a bell...?"

sonia @talking2mouth "He taught Water-type classes, if I remember correctly."

brawly -closedbrow -frownmouth @talkingmouth "Yeah, and he was the teacher of Instructor Wallace. Mentored him, apparently. Not in Kobukan, but back in Hoenn, in Pacifidlog."

falkner @talkingmouth "You mean Sootopolis."

brawly @surprised "Huh? Do I?"

roxanne @talkingmouth "You do."

brawly @closedbrow talking2mouth "Damn. And I spent so long trying to figure out how to pronounce that."
brawly @talkingmouth "Anyway, that part isn't important. Melody and I took Instructor Juan's elective together."
brawly @sadbrow talkingmouth "And what I saw in that class... some people are just bad apples, you know?"

falkner @closedbrow talking2mouth "Well-known for spoiling the bunch, unless immediately {i}removed{/i} from the barrel."

brawly @talkingmouth "She {i}hated{/i} Instructor Juan."

roxanne @closedbrow talking2mouth "That's speculation."

brawly @talkingmouth "Nah, she straight-up said she hated him."

brawly @talkingmouth "The two would get in arguments all the time. Melody would even start screaming at him in class, and he kicked her out of class a ton."
brawly @closedbrow talking2mouth "We're pretty sure her grades were in the toilet, and she was angry that he wasn't bending the rules for her."

roxanne @angrybrow talking2mouth "Please remove the speculation from the record."

falkner @surprised "Yes, your honor."

brawly @talkingmouth "Anyway, one day, Instructor Juan just straight-up disappeared."
brawly @angry "And I'm not pointing fingers, but there's only one person who hated him enough to make that happen."

falkner @sadbrow talking2mouth "You make it sound like she had him kidnapped."
falkner @closedbrow talkingmouth "We know where he is--he's running the Sootopolis Gym. But he disappeared from his teaching position without a word of explanation to his class."
falkner @talking2mouth "We, as Student Council, had to field tons of confused questions about where he was, and what his students should do..."

raihan @talking2mouth "Damn. What happened?"

brawly @happy "Uh, I stepped up. I'm not much of a Water-type teacher, mostly focus on Fighting-types, but the class was, like, totally sunk without someone in charge."

roxanne @closedbrow talkingmouth "He was very noble."

brawly @happy "Ah, I only 'taught' that class for, like a week. Then Chef Kofu took over until Instructor Wallace decided to try teaching."

roxanne @sweat talking2mouth "His students seem happy enough, but it's an irresponsible choice. Teachers hold the livelihoods and futures of their students in their hands. Not something to be done on a whim."

falkner @happy "Roxie's a Steven fangirl. She took it very personally when Wallace trounced him."

roxanne @angrybrow blush poutmouth "S-speculation."

raihan @talkingmouth "So, Melody got a teacher fired. I mean, that's pretty bad, but--"

falkner @closedbrow talkingmouth "{i}Ahem.{/i}"

sonia @talking2mouth "Sorry, carry on."

falkner @talkingmouth "So, yes, as I was saying--social stigma. They were the perfect pairs, created out of perfect people. To break up... whatever occurred must have been tremendous."
falkner @talkingmouth "We, the student body, were left nonplussed and wondering."
falkner @angrybrow talking2mouth "Until, of course, everything became incredibly clear. Violet's--or perhaps Daisy or Lily's, I don't remember which--ex confessed to Melody."
