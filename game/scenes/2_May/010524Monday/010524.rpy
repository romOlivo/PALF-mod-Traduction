dawn @sadbrow talkingmouth "Sorry. Yes. Yes, I can. Coverage moves are moves a Pokémon is trained to learn to be able to compete with Pokémon that aren't weak to their primary type... or types."

oak @talkingmouth "Correct. The list of coverage moves every Pokémon might have is massive, and is not something I would recommend one try to memorize."
oak @talking2mouth "Many matchups that seem like foregone victories can easily become lost causes if one of the two has a single, key, move that turns the tide in the opposite direction."

oak @talkingmouth "Doctor Katsura--Instructor Blaine, to you--mentioned once he was battling a trainer who possessed a Feraligatr. Only Blaine's Rapidash and the foe's Feraligatr were strong enough to battle."
oak @closedbrow talkingmouth "Doctor Katsura's Rapidash had the speed advantage, but that advantage does not mean much if one is not capable of landing a finishing blow before becoming knocked out oneself."
oak @talkingmouth "However, his Rapidash had a trick up its sleeve--Wild Charge. By using a move the challenger did not expect, a move that many Rapidash do not know, Doctor Katsura was able to take his challenger off-guard and defeat him."
oak @closedbrow talkingmouth "It may interest you to know that challenger was none other than Champion Lance himself."

leaf uniform @surprised "What?"

oak @talkingmouth "This expresses the importance of coverage moves. They allowed a Gym Leader to beat a Champion!" 
oak @happy "Doctor Katsura's Fire-type moves would have failed to have any impact on Champion Lance's dragons and Water-type, but through clever moveset creation, he was able to pull out a victory." 
oak @talking2mouth "Granted, Lance was {i}not{/i} a champion at that time."

blue uniform @confused "Lance doesn't use a Feraligatr."

oak @closedbrow talking2mouth sweat "No, not anymore. I am not certain, but I believe he retired that member of his team shortly before his attainment of the Kanto Champion title."
