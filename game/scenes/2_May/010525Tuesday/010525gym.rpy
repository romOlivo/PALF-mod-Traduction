alder @happy2 "If you can tell how much experience a Pokémon has, you can figure out how hard a Pokémon will fight."

bruno norm3 @norm4 "State your concerns."

brendan @talking2mouth "Sure. Uh, I just don't get how knowing a Pokémon's age helps us know how it'll fight."
brendan @happy "Sorry, I get that's the most basic part of what you're tryin' to explain."

alder @happy2 "Totally fine! I'm sure lots of other people would appreciate a further explanation, too."

    brendan @closedbrow talkingmouth "Yeah. Uh, Instructor Bruno moved around the battlefield a lot more, and he used his Pokémon's type advantages against you and Leaf."

brendan @talking2mouth "But you kinda just stood there, and sent out really powerful moves."

alder @happy2 "That's exactly right!"
alder @talkingmouth "And Pokémon are the same way."
alder @closedbrow talkingmouth "Younger Pokémon usually attack more quickly, and are less careful about spending their energy. Older Pokémon often prefer to line up precise, powerful, attacks that are guaranteed to hit."
alder @talkingmouth "These preferred battle-style preferences are often categorized in groups, called 'Natures'."
alder @happy2 "Of course, there's many other factors besides age--personality is a significant one--but even personality often changes with age."

pause 0.5

alder @talkingmouth "Anyway, does that help, Brendan?"

brendan @happy "Totally!"
brendan @sadbrow talking2mouth "But, uh... I got another question, though..."

alder @happy2 "That's what we're here for."

brendan @talking2mouth "How do we figure out the ages of Pokémon? Like, they all look the same, don't they?"

alder @talkingmouth "Not necessarily. It takes an experienced eye, though. Not even Pokédexes are accurate enough to determine age at a glance."
alder @talking2mouth "A lot of what you'll want to look for are the same sorts of things you'd look for in human beings--size is an indicator. Greying plumage or fur is a significant one."
alder @talking2mouth closedbrow "Scratching or chipping on teeth, horns, or scales..."
alder @happy2 "Oh, and for you Charmander fans out there, a lot of Fire-type Pokémon have exposed flames. On younger Pokémon, the flames tend to be larger, and redder. Older Pokémon have yellower, smaller, flames."
alder @talking2mouth "Bug Pokémon don't tend to live that long, ten to thirty years, depending on size. Though there are exceptions, like Volcarona, which can easily live longer than humans."
alder @closedbrow talking2mouth "...They don't always, though."
alder @talkingmouth "Most mid-size mammalian Pokémon, like Herdier or Raichu, live somewhere from thirty to fifty years. Dragons can hit a hundred, often more."
alder @closedbrow talking2mouth "These are just generalizations, of course. And it's worth noting that an unevolved Pokémon might be very old, or an evolved Pokémon may be very young."
alder @talking2mouth "'Experience', capital 'E', is a measure of their ability to use Pokémon Energy--Pokénergy--not life experience."
alder @happy2 "Only thing that can measure {i}that{/i} is a calendar!"

brendan @closedbrow talking2mouth "Uh-huh... okay. Does the lifespan of a Pokémon change when it evolves, then? Like, you said Raichu could live thirty to fifty years." 
brendan @talkingmouth "What about Pichu? A friend told me Pichu evolves into Pikachu, then Raichu, but, like, Pichu's way smaller, right? Does that mean evolving lets it live longer?"

alder @happy2 "Good thinking! Evolution does not seem to change the lifespan of a Pokémon, though. Even a Bagon, for example, could live over a hundred years, even if it never evolves."

brendan @happy "Thanks, Sir! That really helps a ton."

bruno @norm2 "Of course, there are some Pokémon where a visual assessment is simply not possible."
bruno @norm4 "Many Ghost-types do not ever visually change, nor do they age. Some Steel-types are similarly visually unchanging, though they {i}do{/i} age."

alder @talking2mouth "In cases like those, your best bet might really just be size. Almost all Pokémon get bigger with age, even if they don't... 'age.'"

brendan @talkingmouth "That's wild. Why do they get bigger, then, if they don't age?"

alder @closedbrow happymouth "Beats me! One of the Professors probably knows."

bruno @sad2 "Alder, we know this." 
bruno @norm4 "It's because an unaging Pokémon's maturity is connected to their accumulation of Pokémon Energy."
bruno @think2 "Since they are gathering more energy, it affects their physical body, too."
bruno @norm2 "Many martial artists and Pokémon train to allow their energy to influence their body, but for some Pokémon, it is a condition of their birth."

alder @talking2mouth "Oh, yeah, I think I heard about that once."
alder @talkingmouth "Wasn't there some {i}massive{/i} Haunter causing trouble in Kanto? It was, like, hundreds of years old, right?"

bruno @sad2 "'Black Fog'. Celadon City's darkest hour."
bruno @norm2 "Fortunately, the Pokémon was captured, retrained, and released."

alder @talking2mouth "Huh. How'd they catch it?"

bruno norm @norm2 "{size=30}...Massive Poké Ball.{/size}"

alder @happy2 "Come again?"

bruno @angry2 "We used a massive stone Poké Ball."

alder @happy2 "I {i}have{/i} to hear the logistics of this."

bruno @norm2 "I cannot begin to name the reasons why that won't work, but let us discuss this later. It's time for the battles."
