sonia @talking2mouth "Emeras exist in a wholly unstable state--even attempts in laboratories to solidify their structure haven't managed to produce anything that stays stable for more than 10 minutes."
sonia @closedbrow talkingmouth "They can only coalesce in an environment saturated with Mysteriosity."

red @talkingmouth "Mysteriosity?"

sonia @closedbrow talkingmouth "A natural phenomenon that certain wild locations seem to exhibit. Woods, caves, oceans." 
sonia @talking2mouth "We don't know much about it, though. Anytime humans move into an area with Mysteriosity, the Mysteriosity fades in a matter of days."

red @closedbrow frownmouth "Hm."
red @talkingmouth "So unless Professor Oak can get those gems into a wood, or a big cave, without being there, they'll just break apart in a couple minutes."

oak @talkingmouth "I have a theory."

narrator "Professor Oak holds out his hand, and the gems are still there, whole and unblemished."

sonia @confused "What?"

oak @closedbrow talkingmouth "I believe that the meteorite was not consumed entirely by [pika_name]'s transformation."
oak @talking2mouth "Rather, I believe that he still has a tremendous amount of energy within him."
oak @closedbrow talkingmouth "We have seen how [pika_name]'s distinctive tail has grown larger from the transformation, and the starburst patterns on his cheeks certainly evoke the idea of energy 'exploding' out of him."

pause 1.0

oak @talkingmouth "However, that only explains how he might vent the excess energy from the meteorite's shards."
oak @closedbrow talkingmouth "The 'matter' in question is still unaccounted for."
oak @talking2mouth "Ergo, my theory is that the matter has crystallized into this... Emera-like form."

pause 1.0

oak @closedbrow talkingmouth "As these are not Emeras, and merely resemble them strongly, I suggest a new name." 
oak @talkingmouth "While Emeras were named after their ephemeral nature, it would do to name these new gems after their permanency."
oak @closedbrow talkingmouth "May I suggest, perhaps, 'Foreveralds?'"
oak @happy "As a portmanteau of 'forever' and 'emerald', I find it quite clever!"

sonia @closedbrow talkingmouth "...It sounds like you're saying 'forever old', though."

oak @surprised "Oh."
oak @closedbrow talking2mouth "Yes, I suppose that's right. Cut the 'd', then. 'Foreverals' sounds like an attractive enough title for my next paper."

red @talkingmouth "Okay."

red @closedbrow talking2mouth "Um... should we get [pika_name] some tummy medication, then?"

oak @surprised "Lad? I don't think you understand just what a monumental occurrence this is for science!"

red @happy "No, I definitely don't."

oak @talkingmouth "[pika_name] has not only managed to--somehow--transform into a member of an extinct species, but has also managed to metastasize whole, stable Emera-like gems within his own body."
oak @closedbrow talkingmouth "I cannot {i}begin{/i} to describe how extraordinary this is. His gut flora must be fascinating."

red @talkingmouth "Cool. And... what, exactly... should I do?"

oak @closedbrow talking2mouth "Well, your admission to Blueberry Academy is quite off the table, now. You simply {i}must{/i} stay here for observation."

redmind @sadbrow frownmouth "So... the same deal as before, then?"

oak @talkingmouth "In any case, it seems your issues with your classmates should be resolved now. I saw your speech. Quite well-put. I can't imagine anyone should have any problems with you after that."

redmind @sadbrow frownmouth "Oh, Sam..."

oak @closedbrow talking2mouth "For now, I might suggest that you take these Foreverals and take good care of them."

red @surprised "Really? You don't want to run tests on them?"

oak @talkingmouth "I certainly do, and I'd appreciate if you drop in, often, such that I may run more. But you {i}did{/i} say that you wanted today to be a day of relaxation. And I've run a decent number of tests already."
oak @closedbrow talkingmouth "My understanding is that these Foreverals are attuned to a certain kind of Pokémon. If you were to give these Foreverals to a Pokémon, that Pokémon should have its abilities enhanced."
oak @closedbrow talking2mouth "I do not understand what rhyme or reason there is to it." 
oak @talking2mouth "It seems to enhance a Pokémon by altering its DNA, similar to an evolutionary stone, but the changes seem to be {i}based on{/i} something no less arbitrary than the Pokémon's wishes."
oak @talkingmouth "Nevertheless, I am certain some sort of practical battle application can be found for this."

red @confused "Oh, like an item?"

oak @talkingmouth "Partially. But as this is uncharted territory, and these gems are {i}quite{/i} small, I can't imagine there's any harm in giving a Pokémon both an item {i}and{/i} a Foreveral."

red @happy "Oh, awesome!"

oak @talkingmouth "There's one more thing. [pika_name], as the source of these Foreverals, seems as though he could be compatible with {i}any{/i} Foreveral, or possibly even combinations of Foreverals."
oak @closedbrow talking2mouth "However, in order to avoid over-taxing his system before we know what he's capable of, and better understand the nature of Foreverals, I might recommend you give him only one at a time for now."
