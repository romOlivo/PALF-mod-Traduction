oak @talkingmouth "Today's quiz is going to introduce a new concept to you--{i}trained{/i} Pokémon."

redmind uniform @thinking "Hm? {b}Trained{/b} Pokémon?"

oak @talkingmouth "You are probably familiar by now with certain moves that were invented by faculty at Kobukan."
oak @talkingmouth "These moves are powerful, and can be used as a surprise tool to take opponents off-guard, as they're not commonly known outside of Kobukan."
oak @talkingmouth "Of course, this {i}does{/i} imply that your fellow students are likely to have access to these moves, as well."

pause 0.5

oak @talkingmouth "It is not always apparent what moves your classmates may have access to." 
oak @talkingmouth "However, Pokémon with these special moves often show some particular behavior, some visually-identifiable characteristics, that make it clear that they're a specially-trained Pokémon."
oak @talkingmouth "Once you get used to looking for those behavioral patterns, they're as clear to a keen-eyed trainer as the Pokémon's level!"

pause 0.5

oak @talkingmouth "Well... this is something you should keep an eye out for, for future information."

oak @talkingmouth "Now, for the upcoming test, you may be relieved to hear that [bluecolor]none of your opponents are able to damage you.{/color} However, it should be noted that [bluecolor]a specially-trained Fighting-type has the move 'Stone Cold Stunner'.{/color}" 
oak @talkingmouth "[bluecolor]If you let the particular Pokémon use this move, you will automatically lose the fight, regardless of what other Pokémon you have on hand! Do what you can to prevent that!{/color} "

yellow @talking2mouth "Okay, we can definitely do that. Making a character from scratch usually takes quite a while, so we made some pre-made characters for you to choose from."

blue @talkingmouth "Every single one of the characters is completely optimized. I made them myself. {i}No-one{/i} could make a better character at that level, with that race/class combination."
