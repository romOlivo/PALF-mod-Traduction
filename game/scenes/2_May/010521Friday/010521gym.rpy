alder @happy2 "Well, that's the end of the lecture. Time for the big show, eh? We {i}did{/i} promise, after all."

raihan uniform @talkingmouth "Blimey. A real battle between an Elite Four and a Champion... and it's happening in a bog-standard gymnasium."

misty uniform @talkingmouth "That's how we do it everywhere but Galar."

raihan @happy "Oh, I know! I'm not complaining! It's just crazy to me that people can still have real battles like this without someone slapping a camera down, and trying to sell merch off it."

rosa uniform @surprisedbrow talking2mouth "...Oh. I was planning on recording this fight, actually..."

alder @happy2 "Haha! Video is fine, but no flash photography in the gymnasium, please! Bruno gets jumpy."

bruno @happy2 "Alder, you're stalling. Are you perhaps afraid of facing the strongest Fighting-type Master in Kanto?"

alder @happy2 "Not a chance, friend! Just building up the audience with a bit of trash talk."

bruno @happy2 "Hm. Trash talk, eh?"
