oak @talkingmouth "...Which is why Hyper Beam is a particularly effective finishing move. At least, it {i}was{/i} when I was champion."
oak @happy "Yes, I myself had a particular Tauros that managed to utilize the adrenaline rush from knocking out a foe to push through the shock of launching a Hyper Beam!"
oak @talking2mouth "Unfortunately, in his old age, he has lost that ability... and I've not been able to replicate that technique in any of the other Pokémon I've trained. I suppose I, too, have lost that ability."
oak @closedbrow sweat talking2mouth "And unlike my dear Tauros, I cannot be sent to a farm outside Goldenrod to live a life surrounded by amorous Miltank."
oak @talking2mouth "Of course, using our modern understanding of battle techniques, Hyper Beam was not the best move to use in that situation--Giga Impact would have been far better, given my Tauros' significantly higher physical attack stat."

oak @talking2mouth "You know, back in the day, Agatha used an Arbok on her team. That Arbok knew Wrap, and Wrap, I swear, was a move that prevented the foe from moving for multiple turns, locking them down {i}and{/i} damaging them."
oak @happy "Why, it seemed as though Wrap was a move that combined the advantages of both the Frozen and Poisoned status conditions, but did not overlap with either!"

pause 1.0

oak @closedbrow talking2mouth "But... that's simply not true. My memories of Wrap's strength are fiction. Perhaps I only thought it was so strong because Agatha used it to beat me as many times as I used Hyper Beam to beat her."
oak @happy "You know, she never admitted this, but I believe she learned to train Ghost-types specifically because she feared my Hyper Beam so much!"
