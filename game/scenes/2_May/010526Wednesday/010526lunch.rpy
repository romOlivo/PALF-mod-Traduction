red @unamusedbrow talking2mouth "I may actually die of anticipation."

leaf @closedbrow talkingmouth "Classic. Made it four weeks, but that last three hours was the straw on the Camerupt's back."

red @talking2mouth "The time of death on my gravestone is going to have to be very specific."

leaf @closedbrow talkingmouth "Huh. I just realized something--how come they don't put cause of death on gravestones any more?"

red @confused "You know, I don't know. I don't think I realized until {i}just now{/i} that that was a thing."

leaf @talkingmouth "Okay, I've got a different question. What the hell kinds of cemeteries do you have in Pallet Town?"

red @talking2mouth "Apparently cemeteries populated by people who, in life, were pretty vulnerable to getting run over by equine Pokémon."

leaf @closedbrow talkingmouth "That's going to be the new battle meta. Pallet-types are weak to Horse-types."
