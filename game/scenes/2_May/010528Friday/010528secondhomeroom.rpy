oak @talking2mouth "Champion Lance won the Kanto Championship in 1995, after thirty-four attempts. Breaking with all tradition, Lance executed many of these attempts back-to-back." 
oak @talkingmouth "On May 5th, 1995, Champion Lance launched four formal challenge attempts in a row, a record that has never been beaten before or since."
oak @closedbrow talking2mouth "Of course, the record prior was 'one challenge.' To this day, Champion Lance is the only person who has ever challenged a formal Pokémon League multiple times in a single day."
oak @talkingmouth "His efforts paid off November 11th of the same year. On his thirty-fourth attempt at the Kanto League, he finally became the Kanto champion."

oak @talkingmouth "Yes, I believe that's correct."

hilbert @talkingmouth "But after May 5th, he took a long break. Why was that? He didn't resume his challenges until October, almost six months later."

oak @talkingmouth "In any case, after attaining the Kanto championship, he allowed himself to rest on that victory for a few years. In early 2001, however, he began challenging the Johto league."
oak @talkingmouth "Seventeen attempts later, on the same day he had won the Kanto championship six years earlier, he was entered into another Hall of Fame, becoming the first two-time regional Champion in history."

oak @talkingmouth "That's correct. Specifically, they are to be challenged in the order of Instructors Will, Koga, Bruno, and Karen."
oak @talkingmouth "However, this Elite Four is formed from unique circumstances, due to the aforementioned consolidation of the Kanto and Johto Leagues."
oak @talking2mouth "Instructors Will and Karen were members of the Johto league that elected to stay on after Lance's ascension."
oak @closedbrow talking2mouth "Elite Four Bruno is in the same position, on the Kanto side of things. And Instructor Koga was recruited from his Gym Leader position by Lance directly."

pause 1.0

oak @angrybrow talkingmouth "But what of the Elite Four that were not carried forward into the Indigo League? Analyzing their history may provide the greatest insight into Champion Lance's weaknesses, given how often..."
oak @sadbrow talkingmouth "...Well, how often they beat him, frankly."
oak @talking2mouth "The Johto league Elite Four members that were not retained were named Walker Wayne and Magnus Kobushi."
oak @closedbrow talking2mouth "Walker, a Flying-type specialist, was a former Gym Leader in Violet city." 
oak @talkingmouth "He supposedly took his defeat at Champion Lance's hands quite poorly, and immediately left Johto, swearing not to return until he could prove himself the superior Flying-type master."
oak @happy "One supposes that he mistook Champion Lance for a bird keeper, as opposed to a dragon tamer!"

may @closedbrow uniform sadmouth "{size=30}Hm... that sounds familiar... was it something Brendan told me...?{/size}"

oak @talkingmouth "Magnus was a Fighting-type specialist, and was apparently quite inspired by the spirit of competition and battle that Lance showed him." 
oak @talkingmouth "He decided that he wanted to spread that spirit of competition to all of Johto, founding the Pokéathlon dome just outside of Goldenrod City."
oak @talking2mouth "Of course, the Pokéathlon has existed for centuries, but there had never been a single home to practice all events in, that could support such a large audience."

oak @happy "Ah, yes. There was no Johtonian champion at the time of Champion Lance's ascension."
oak @talkingmouth "So, let's go over to the Kanto side of things."
oak @talkingmouth "The biggest impediment to his success in his Kanto League attempts was, of course, Lorelei Kanna. Perhaps you have heard her referenced by other faculty--she is Kobukan's trustworthy legal representation."

pause 0.5

oak @talkingmouth "I believe he only had {i}one{/i} Pokémon that could resist Miss Kanna's many piercing Ice-type attacks. Indeed, the majority of his thirty-four Kanto runs started and ended at Miss Kanna's doorway."
oak @talking2mouth "...Perhaps neither could endure the other. Immediately upon Champion Lance's ascendancy, Miss Kanna left the Elite Four."
oak @closedbrow talking2mouth "Whether she left of her own will, or Champion Lance dismissed her, it is not clear."
oak @happy "But I imagine one or the other would be happy to divulge the details!"
oak @talking2mouth sweat "Though... it seems likely that one may need to talk to both to get the {i}full{/i} picture."

pause 1.0

oak @talkingmouth "The fourth Elite Four member was an Alolan girl, actually. Mina. Though quite young, she had prodigious skill, and was a master of the Fairy-type, which has seen {i}very{/i} little success in Kanto, historically."
oak @confused "And she... well, after Lance won against her... she just wandered off. It seems that the third Elite Four member simply hired a child to fill that empty 'strongest Elite Four' position slot as way to 'mock' Champion Lance."
oak @talkingmouth "This was before the Paldean league debuted an even {i}younger{/i} child as a core member of their Elite Four, of course." 
oak @sweat closedbrow talking2mouth "Perhaps it wouldn't have been considered as humorous to lose to an Elite Four containing a child twenty times if such a thing had already been common in another region."
