alder @happy2 "Good morning, everyone! Great to see you in class again."

bruno @norm2 "It is a pleasure."

alder @talkingmouth "We've been through single, double, and triple battles this semester, so let's start working on team-based battles. We'll assign you a partner, and you'll battle two other trainers."
alder @happy2 "How does that sound?"

sonia uniform @talking2mouth "It's all random, then?"

alder @happy2 "Not quite. We try to match up pairs based on skill level, as well as fights we think might be interesting to watch."

nate uniform @happy "I'm game! Let's see how we end up being paired!"

may uniform @happy "Oh, wow, we're getting paired up randomly? That's so fun!"

brendan uniform @talking2mouth "Wouldn't it be crazy if we ended up getting paired up together, anyway?"

may @talkingmouth "You're right! It totally would be! I'll cross my fingers, though!"

redmind uniform "Hm... I wonder who I'll get paired up with?"

bruno norm @norm2 "[first_name], you will be battling alongside Bianca."
bruno @surprised2 "Uh, the one in the green hat."
