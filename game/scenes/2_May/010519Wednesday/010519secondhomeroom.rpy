may @talkingmouth "Eh?"
may -surprisedbrow -frownmouth -surprised @closedbrow sadmouth "Shoot, that's a tricky one. I'm going to say... the Scope Lens."

kris @talkingmouth "Okay. Could you elaborate on this, please?"

may @talkingmouth "Well, Focus Energy and Night Slash are Pokémon moves. And Razor Fangs are teeth dropped by a Pokémon."
may @talkingmouth "So those three are natural. But the Scope Lens is an item created by... {w=0.5}{size=30}um, not Devon...{/size} {w=0.5}Silph, I think."
may @talkingmouth "So the Scope Lens is the only man-made item or move in that list."

kris @happy "That's very clever, May! Professor Birch is always gushing about you, you know."

may @sadbrow talkingmouth "Aw. That's my Dad for you..."

kris @sadbrow talkingmouth "Now, I'm afraid that wasn't the answer I was {i}looking{/i} for, but it was still a correct one."

kris @talkingmouth "Now, remember what I said in class yesterday about critical hits? That you can guarantee a critical hit if you have three different sources boosting your critical hit ratio?"
kris @talkingmouth "Focus Energy actually counts as 'two' sources. The battle drug 'Dire Hit' does as well. So if you use a move with a high critical hit ratio, like Leaf Blade, after using a Dire Hit, it will be a guaranteed crit."

pause 0.5

kris @closedbrow talkingmouth "Let's see... the exact ratios for no crit stages, one crit stage, two crit stages, and three or more are..."
kris @talkingmouth "4.17%%, 12.5%%, 50%%, and of course, 100%%. You won't need to know these exact ratios for the test, though, but they're good to keep in mind."
