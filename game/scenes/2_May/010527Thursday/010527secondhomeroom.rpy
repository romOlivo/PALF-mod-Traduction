oak @talkingmouth "Welcome back to class, ladies and gentlemen."
oak @talking2mouth "Now, can anyone here quickly recap what I covered in this morning's lecture?"

pause 0.5

oak @happy "Miss Green."

leaf uniform @talking2mouth "You were talking about terrains, and how they change Camouflage. When using Camouflage on an active terrain, you change into the type of Pokémon that the terrain helps."

oak @talkingmouth "Quite right."
oak @sweat talking2mouth "Now, I've mentioned before how to {i}create{/i} a terrain. But sometimes one does not want the battlefield to be altered. There are four ways of removing terrains that I recommend you brush up on."

oak @closedbrow talkingmouth "The first method is simply overwriting the terrain with one of your own. If Misty Terrain is currently in effect, and a Grookey with the ability 'Grassy Surge' comes in, the terrain will be...? Ms. Moore."

flannery uniform @talking2mouth "Uh, Leafy Terrai--"
flannery uniform @surprised "Wait! Sorry, got mixed up. Grassy!"
flannery uniform @lightblush happy "Grassy Terrain."

oak @talkingmouth "Correct. This may seem basic, but using terrain-setting moves is the simplest way to get rid of a different terrain."
oak @talkingmouth "It is not, however, the most common way terrains disappear. Terrains will, of their own accord, disappear after five standard turns."

hilbert surprised @closedbrow talkingmouth "Or eight turns if-"

oak @angrybrow talking2mouth "Mr. Von Schwarzdrachen. Please do not interrupt me."
oak @talkingmouth "You are correct, but it is disrespectful to both me and your classmates to continually interrupt."

pause 1.0

hilbert closedbrow smilemouth "Hmph."

hide hilbert with dis

oak @talkingmouth "What Mr. Von Schwarzdrachen says is correct. Terrains last for eight turns if the user is holding the 'Terrain Extender' item."
oak @happy "This is one of those items whose function is entirely apparent from the name--much more sensibly named than the 'Life Orb', which is an orb that 'removes' life."
oak @talking2mouth "But that's a lecture for the future, I suppose."

pause 1.0

oak @talkingmouth "Ah, now we come to the crux of the matter. Please take notes on this--exams are open-book, so there's no reason not to, unless you're worried about carpal tunnel syndrome."
oak @closedbrow sweat talking2mouth "{size=30}In which case you should be quite thankful you are not in Professor Willow's class. His students go through pencils like they're {i}eating{/i} them. But that won't be on the test.{/size}"
oak sad2eyes @talkingmouth "The third and final way a terrain may be removed is through a series of moves that {i}explicitly{/i} perform that function."

narrator "Oak takes a quick glance at his notes."

pause 0.5

narrator "You suddenly realize that Professor Oak has notes. For as long as you'd known him, he had {i}never{/i} written down a plan."

redmind uniform @surprisedbrow frownmouth "Wow. Professor Cherry really did a number on him."

oak -sad2eyes @closedbrow talking2mouth "Defog, Ice Spinner, Steel Roller... these moves will {i}entirely{/i} remove any extant terrain, without replacing it."
oak @talkingmouth "They have other effects, too, of course. Defog and Mortal Spin will remove hazards on your side of the field--Defog will extend the same courtesy to your opponents, while also removing any barriers in place." 
oak @closedbrow talking2mouth "Light Screen, Reflect, that sort of thing."
oak @talkingmouth "Steel Roller is a very powerful Steel-type move, hitting well above the comparable Iron Head or Flash Cannon. That being said, it will entirely fail if there is no active terrain when used."
oak @confusedeyebrows talking2mouth "One can see, then, how its large damage potential is mitigated by the logistics of sustaining an active terrain every time you want to use it."

pause 0.5

oak @talkingmouth "And... well, I believe that's the end of the lecture. You should now know everything you need to pass the upcoming test with flying colors."
oak @sweat talking2mouth closedbrow "Of course, I've generally been advised to {i}avoid{/i} teaching to the test, but... I think at this point that doing so may be for the best."
oak @talking2mouth "On the subject of the test, there are three pieces of information you should remember." 
oak @talkingmouth "The first is that your opponent will exclusively attack your Kecleon, as long as it is able to. You must not let them. If your Kecleon takes a single point of damage, you cannot pass this exam."
oak @talking2mouth "The second thing to remember is that {i}almost{/i} all Pokémon on the field will be burned and equipped with an Air Balloon. I suppose it was very hot air!"
oak @talking2mouth "The final thing is that your opponent will only use the following moves--Leech Seed, Dragon Claw, and Bullet Punch."
oak @closedbrow talkingmouth "It will be up to you to determine which opposing Pokémon will use which move, and then what you need to do to counter it."
oak @talkingmouth "Abilities are extremely important in this test. Before you commit to any moves, look over your Pokémon, and make sure you understand what their abilities do."

pause 0.5

oak @talkingmouth "If no-one has any questions, then...?"

pause 1.0

oak @happy "Then please take out your pencils. I know I need not tell you that [bluecolor]this will be graded.{/color}"

red @confused "Well, I'm stumped."

blue @closedbrow talkingmouth "Maybe Chuchu's too weak to handle it?"

yellow @closedbrow talking2mouth "You train my Pokémon, Blue. Isn't it the same training you've given your Eevee?"

blue @happy "Hah! I train {i}my{/i} Pokémon (and Leaf's Dratini) by putting them through the grinder, sending them up against massive amounts of foes, and pushing them to their absolute limit." 
blue @talkingmouth "I train {i}your{/i} Pokémon by giving them softball opponents that they're never in any actual danger from."

yellow @surprised "Wh... why?"

blue @surprised "Wait, you didn't know? I thought you didn't want your Pokémon to evolve. That kind of training is ideal for building up a Pokémon's energy without causing them to want to evolve."
blue @talkingmouth "It's called 'Soft-hand Training'. Normally people who want to train their Pokémon for fun, but only to keep them as pets, use it."

yellow -frownmouth @talking2mouth "Oh. Well, yes, that's correct."

blue @closedbrow talkingmouth "If you {i}do{/i} want your Pokémon to evolve, just let me know. I can do that, too."
blue @talkingmouth "Maybe evolution would make your r--{w=0.5}{i}Chuchu{/i} strong enough to handle that Foreveral."

red @talkingmouth "We can ask your grandfather about it. He might have some theories."

blue -frownmouth @closedbrow talkingmouth "Yeah."

redmind @confusedeyebrows frownmouth "That's interesting, though... Yellow doesn't want her Pokémon to evolve? Why would that be?"
