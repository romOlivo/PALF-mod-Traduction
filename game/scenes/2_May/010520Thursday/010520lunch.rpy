red @happy sweat "Well, I was trying to think of what a good present would be, but, uh, I'm kinda tight on money."
red @talkingmouth "So then I thought maybe I could make the cake. I'm not half bad at cooking myself, but I don't have, like, any ingredients, or cooking tools."
red @talkingmouth "I was wondering if you know where the best place to go for that stuff would be."

may @happy "Oh, that'd definitely be the Cooking Club!"

red @confused "We have a Cooking Club?"

may @talkingmouth "Yup. It was only started a week or two ago, I think. Anyway, they have ingredients, ovens, stoves, all that stuff. And it's all completely free to use for clubmembers!"

red @happy "Well, that's where our tuition is going, I guess."

red @talkingmouth "Alola? Like the region?"

mallow @talkingmouth "It means 'Hello!' in the old Alolan language. The region was named after our word for 'hello!'"
mallow @happy "That's because we're famous for our hospitality! Alola's a fantastic place to visit over Summer break, you know, and not just because of the gorgeous weather!" 
mallow @talkingmouth "The Aether Foundation's got an amazing internship program!"

redmind @happy "This girl's enthusiasm is kinda infectious. I suspect she might work for the Alolan tourism board... and if she doesn't, they should hire her."

red @talkingmouth "Sounds pretty great. But you mentioned the Cooking Club? (Or, I did, anyway.)"

mallow @surprised "Oh!"
mallow @happy "Right, {i}auwe!{/i} I got so excited to sell you on Alola, I completely forgot why I was here."
mallow @talkingmouth "We at the Cooking Club would {i}love{/i} to have you!"

red @talkingmouth "I'd love to check it out. I'm part of the Battle Team, but it would be fun to drop into the club once in a while."

mallow @talking2mouth "Well, actually... I guess some younger people might not know. But I'm really into Alola's history and lore and stuff."
mallow @happy "And I just {i}love{/i} sharing my passions, so getting to share my love of cooking, and my {i}secret{/i} knowledge of your Pikachu is like a dream come true! It's like a warm day on Akala's beaches!"
