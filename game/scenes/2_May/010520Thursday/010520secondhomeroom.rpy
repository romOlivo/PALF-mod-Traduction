red @happy "My bad."

mallow @happy "It's alright. We Alolans are {i}famously{/i} forgiving."
mallow @talkingmouth "Anyway, this was in, um, the 1600s. So, like... 1200 years since the third Unovan Civil War, I think, when they overthrew their kings."

red @closedbrow talking2mouth "Uh, sorry, I think I'm missing some historical context."

mallow @talking2mouth "Oh. Well, I don't really know much about {i}their{/i} history. I think they had two dragons fight each other, and the dragons ruined the country, so the people got angry and overthrew the kings."

red @talking2mouth "Oh, I think I heard about that. And then they installed a President, right? And then that President had a Pikachu like [pika_name]."

mallow @angrybrow talkingmouth "Boom! The Unovans invaded!"

red @surprised "Huh? Who?"

mallow @talking2mouth "Alola, of course."

red @closedbrow talking2mouth "Oh."

mallow @talking2mouth "There were a bunch of factors, but basically the Unovans wanted our land to create banana farms."
mallow @talking2mouth "The biggest thing was that we had kings, though. The Unovans didn't like that."

red @confused "Were your kings, like, corrupt or evil or something?"

mallow @talkingmouth "They're historical figures, so it's hard to know objectively, but... nothing in {i}our{/i} history says they were."

mallow @talking2mouth "So the Unovans attacked our shores, intent on 'liberating' us from our kings."
mallow @sad "Our kings rode out to meet them, astride their Water-type Pokémon, their partner Tapus behind them."
mallow @talkingmouth "They knew they didn't have a chance. The Unovans were backed up by an impossibly large force of Liberation Pikachu."

red @talking2mouth "Right..."

mallow @talkingmouth "From what the kings knew, the battle was a foregone conclusion. The Liberation Pikachu had strange and unnatural powers."
mallow @talkingmouth "They could copy the abilities of their allies, and even their enemies. They could summon warrior spirits to aid them in battle, and were even able to strike with the force of the Mega-Evolved Pokémon from Kalos."

red @talkingmouth "So they thought they'd already lost when they rode out to fight the Unovan Navy."

mallow -frownmouth @talkingmouth "Yep. But the Deities urged them to fight anyway, so they did."
mallow @talkingmouth "And this is the strangest thing. During the fight, apparently, none of the Liberation Pikachu used their powers. It seemed as though they were entirely unwilling to fight--or almost like they {i}couldn't{/i}, for some reason."

red @surprised "Really? They just refused to fight?"

mallow @talkingmouth "That's what the folklore says."
mallow @happy "So then the Guardian Deities absorbed their Z-Power from the kings, and turned into four giant, glowing, golden, Guardians of Alola!"
