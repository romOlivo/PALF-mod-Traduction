nessa @talkingmouth "Come to think of it, Sunny, what happened to your Pokémon last year?"

sonia @confused "What do you mean, Ness?"

nessa @talkingmouth "Well, your Pokémon are a bit low-level, aren't they? And they're unevolved, too."

sonia @sad "Er... that's sort of what happens when you fall out of practice, when you don't pick up a Poké Ball for a year. And I never evolved most of my Pokémon because... well..."
sonia @happy "Would you throw something at me if I said it was because Yamper's too bloody cute to give up?"

nessa @closedbrow talkingmouth "You're impossible."

yellow @sadbrow talking2mouth "I-if it helps at all, I, um... I understand where you're coming from, Sonia. I don't really want to evolve my Pokémon, either."

sonia @talking2mouth "Er... thanks. But you failed to clear the first round of the Quarter Qlashes, didn't you?"

yellow @closedbrow talking2mouth "Yes."

nessa @talkingmouth "Wonder if there's a connection there."

sonia @angry "Ness! Honestly, when did you get so sassy?"

nessa @talkingmouth "Being around Raihan again's reforged all the 'sass' synapses in my mind, I think. I didn't have anyone to match up against before now."
