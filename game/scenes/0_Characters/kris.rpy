red @surprised "Huh?"

kris @talkingmouth "Back in postgrad, my classmates barely even saw me, I spent so much time studying. I was on the fast-track, as well. They didn't even know what my name was, most of them, so they just called me 'Catcher.'"
kris @happy "It took a last-minute intervention from the Dean to make sure that my degree didn't say 'Catcher Cherry' on it."

red @talkingmouth "Huh, I had no idea that catching Pokémon was a complicated enough field to be a science. I kinda thought you--"

kris @closedbrow talkingmouth "--just lowered the opponent Pokémon's HP, then threw a Poké Ball at it. Yes, I know."
kris @angrybrow talkingmouth "Believe me, I've had to explain that capturing Pokémon {i}is{/i} a science to more people than I can count." 
kris @closedbrow talkingmouth "My own parents still don't get what I went to school for, but they'd support me in pretty much anything, after... {w=0.5}after school."

pause 1.0

redmind @surprisedbrow frownmouth "Hm? That was weird."

red @talkingmouth "Well, what's the science of catching about?"

kris @talkingmouth "Well, there are many different kinds of Pokémon, right? And they all have different ways of trying to evade capture."
kris @angrybrow talkingmouth "Now, the thing about the Pokémon's evasion instinct, or 'Compulsive Capture Avoidance', is that they're not {i}truly{/i} trying to avoid being captured."

red @surprised "Huh."

kris @talking2mouth "The reason a Pokémon tries to avoid being captured by a trainer, even if the Pokémon approached the trainer to challenge them, is an evolutionary mechanism."
kris @closedbrow talkingmouth "Long-term evolution, of course, not the short-term metamorphosis we call 'evolution.'"

red @talkingmouth "Right, got it."

kris @talking2mouth "With Pokémon being social creatures, who have evolved and adapted alongside humans, it benefits a Pokémon to make sure only the strongest trainers can catch them."

red @talkingmouth "That's why they fight back against us, in the wild, then?"

kris @happy "That's right!"
kris @talkingmouth "That's also why they attempt to bust out of Poké Balls thrown at them."
kris @talking2mouth "They want us to prove ourselves to them. Personally, I think that's admirable."

red @talkingmouth "But that Venonat you just caught... you didn't weaken it, first, but it just went into the ball?"

#Kris team: Stonjourner, Blaziken, Hitmonlee -- kicks?
kris @happy "Well, that {i}was{/i} a risky move, but I don't have any Pokémon on-hand right now, so I just had to aim for the Pokémon's energy nexus."

pause 1.0

red @confused "Pardon?"

kris @talkingmouth "You know, their nexus. Where they concentrate the energy for their elemental attacks."

pause 0.5

red @confused "I've actually never heard of that before."

kris @surprised "Huh."

pause 0.5

kris @happy "Well, yes, every Pokémon has a nexus that their energy is concentrated in. A 'critical hit' is often the result of hitting that special spot."
kris @talkingmouth "And if you hit the Pokémon on that spot directly with a Poké Ball, that's called a 'Critical Capture.'"

red @talkingmouth "Huh."

kris @sadbrow talkingmouth "They really didn't teach you any of this in high school?"

red @closedbrow talkingmouth "It was a miracle that they taught me {i}anything{/i} in high school, honestly."

kris @closedbrow angrymouth "Hm."
kris @happy "Well, you're lucky that I'm here, then! I'm always ready to help my students outside of class. Heck, as I said, I'm doing office hours now."

red @talkingmouth "Cool. So, learning about these 'Nexus Points' will help me with my capturing skills, right?"

kris @talkingmouth "It should."

red @talking2mouth "Okay, what's the first step?"

kris @closedbrow talking2mouth "Memorizing nexus locations. There isn't really an easy way to do that. You kind of have to just sit down with a book and memorize them slowly."

red @happy "Professor Cherry, I memorized the Pokédex. I can memorize one more data point for every Pokémon."

kris @surprised "Really? The entire Pokédex?"

red @talkingmouth happybrow "Yep. Not purposefully, but I did."

kris @talkingmouth "Alright. Well, let's just get started, then. I'll start in the Kantonian National Pokédex order, as that's what I imagine you're most familiar with."
