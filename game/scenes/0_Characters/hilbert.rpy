    hilbert @closedbrow talkingmouth "This is not an emotional decision. This is based on logic, and reason, and... and... the calculus of justice."

    red @closedbrow talking2mouth "And Hilda doesn't fit into this equation. You'll disappear and leave her alone, with nothing to show for the years she spent with you."
