red @happy "All good. Now, tragic backstory?"

leaf @surprised "Oh! Right."

leaf @talking2mouth "Uh, it's Cinnabar Island."

red @surprised "Wait! Holy shit, I actually {i}do{/i} know that one. The volcano erupted, right? And the island was... obliterated."

leaf @closedbrow talkingmouth "Yeah, it wasn't pretty. But my family lived right on the shore, in a laboratory. We gathered up our Pokémon, helped our neighbors evacuate, and were miles away by the time the lava started flowing."

red @closedbrow talking2mouth "Oh. So it didn't actually, like... hurt you, or anyone you knew?"

leaf @angry "Hey! My childhood home went up in flames! That's plenty of trauma, I'll have you know!"

red @happy "Sorry. I was just expecting... I dunno. More death."

leaf @angrybrow angrymouth "Well, sorry to disappoint. Dickhead."

red @talking2mouth "On a serious note, though, you said you lived in a laboratory?"

leaf @talking2mouth "Ooh, a friends-to-enemies arc?"

red @closedbrow talking2mouth "Wasn't an arc so much as an unexpected and unasked for plot twist."

red @talkingmouth "Yeah, exactly like that. Obnoxious and loud-mouthed. Anyway, I did the exact same thing."

leaf @surprised "What?"
