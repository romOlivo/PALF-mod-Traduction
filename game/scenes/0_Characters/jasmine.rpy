    byron @norm4 "You said yourself that it's a clear liquid. Let me tell you that the kind of liquids I'd be worried about are brown, or black, if coal's involved."

    jasmine @angrybrow talking2mouth "Instructor Byron, I know I'm right about this! You have the ability to test water for poisons and contaminants, don't you? Please, just test the sample I have, and you'll see I'm right."

    byron @angry2 "I'm not going to do one single part of that. You want me to reward you for gambling with your health?"
