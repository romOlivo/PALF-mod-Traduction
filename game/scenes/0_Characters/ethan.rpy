red @sadbrow talkingmouth "Don't know if there was any science behind it, but those little rituals always made the days feel... full. Even though Pallet was a quiet, empty town, having something to do every day helped me make use of my time."

ethan @sad2eyes sadeyebrows talkingmouth "That's why Professor-- ah, screw it, I'm just going to call her Kris."
ethan @talkingmouth "Anyway, that's why Kris and I spent so much time together. Sometimes I'd go to Professor Elm's lab and play there, too."
