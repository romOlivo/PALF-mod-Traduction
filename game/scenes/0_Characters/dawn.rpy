    dawn @closedbrow talkingmouth "She... was not the best person, in retrospect. But she never tried to stop me from doing what I was doing. And she never tried to get me to do anything else. So I hung out with her. All the time, actually."

    red @confused "What do you mean she 'wasn't the best person?' Did she do something wrong?"

    dawn @talkingmouth "Nothing specifically. But... every time I did something, no matter what it was, she'd make fun of me, and criticize even the smallest things. For no reason."
