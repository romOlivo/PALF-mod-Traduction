raihan @happy "I never stopped having fun. And I never tried the same strategy twice."

raihan @talkingmouth "Oh, yeah? How so, mate?"

raihan @happy "Trick question, anyway. I mean, besides the odd water bottle or commemorative jumper, I don't make anything tangible."

raihan @sadbrow talking2mouth "Now, a lot of blokes just take the critics' or influencers' opinion and make it their own, but we would {i}hope{/i} that our opinions are just a foundation, not a whole structure."
raihan @happy "A lot of influencers, then, provide opinions. Right?"

raihan @happy "I want to give people hope. Leon's undefeatable. He really is. But as long as I keep battling him, I give all the kids in Galar hope."
raihan @talkingmouth "You should see my demo info."

red @confused "Demo info?"

raihan @talkingmouth "Right, 'demographics information'. Means the kind of people that follow my accounts. Young, old, men, women, jobs, that kind of stuff."
