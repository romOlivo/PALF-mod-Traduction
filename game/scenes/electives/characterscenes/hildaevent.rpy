    red @confused "So, uh, just out of curiosity, how do you keep Hilbert... uh... in-line? Like, how do you make him heel?"

    hilda frownmouth "I wish there was a single trick that worked all the time. Sometimes I have to bribe him, sometimes I have to threaten him, sometimes both..."

    red @talkingmouth "The ol' carrot and stick. Got it. Well, all I know about you, I've heard Hilbert muttering under his breath."

    hilda sad "I play tennis. Sometimes."

    red @talkingmouth "Oh, yeah? I used to play. Are you any good?"

    hilda happy "Not really! I just liked hitting the ball. Feels good to just {i}smash{/i} something in the face, you know?"

    red @talkingmouth "I'd figure you'd be more of a Baseball girl, then."

    hilda sadbrow -happymouth @talkingmouth "I did try that. Couldn't keep up with the speed, though. And that tiny little ball heading at you at, like, five hundred miles per hour?"
    hilda closedbrow talking2mouth "A baseball hit my ass once, left a bruise for weeks. I beat the hell out of the pitcher--because the punk totally did it on purpose--but that definitely sealed me as a tennis girl."
    hilda sad "God, though, it's been so long since I've actually played..."

    red @talkingmouth "Want to?"

    hilda @happy "Believe me, {i}god yes{/i}. I just don't have any free time."
    hilda thinking veins "I'm a full-time student at Kobukan Academy {i}and{/i} Hilbert's goddamn mom. I don't even have time to breathe my own air."

    red @talkingmouth "Mmm. Well, if I found you outside of classes, and asked if you had some time then... would you hate that?"

    hilda -thinking -veins @talkingmouth "[ellipses]"
    hilda happy "Nah. I wouldn't hate that."

    red @talkingmouth "Sounds like a plan, then. See you around, Hilda."
