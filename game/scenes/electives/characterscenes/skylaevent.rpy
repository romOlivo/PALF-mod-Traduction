    red @talkingmouth "What? I mean, you {i}must{/i} know."

    skyla happy "No, I know, it's just..."
    skyla -happy @talkingmouth "I don't think anyone's ever told me that. Normally I'm the one who tells people I've got good eyes!"

    red @happy "Well, glad I could save you the trouble. Does that come in handy? Are you, uh, a birdwatcher? A photographer?"
    
    skyla @closedbrow talkingmouth "Anyway, I'm actually a pilot."

    red @surprised "What? How old are you?"

    skyla -sweat @angry "What?! You don't ask a girl that!"

    red @happy "Oops, sorry! I just... don't you need to be, like, twenty-five to get a pilot's license?"

    skyla -thinking @talkingmouth "Not sure what the rules are in Kobukan, but in Unova, where I come from, you only need to be seventeen. And I was flying solo since I was sixteen."

    red @talkingmouth "Hey, that's pretty impressive. How'd you end up doing that?"

    red @talkingmouth "Uh... so you had family there, or something?"

    skyla -happy -sweat talkingmouth "Nope. No connection. Well, before I got my pilot's license, anyway."

    red @talkingmouth "So you just... learned to fly planes... to help out a town on the opposite side of the region? That you had no connection to?"

    skyla closedbrow sweat -talkingmouth @talkingmouth "Yyyyyep."

    red happy "That's insane."

    skyla happy sweat "Yeah, I've heard that a lot. But it worked! Lentimas is now officially connected to Mistralton. Since the only other way into Mistralton is through Reversal Mountain, my plane is {i}the{/i} way to get there."

    red -happy @talkingmouth "I'm really impressed. I came up to chat, just expecting a casual conversation, but now... wow."

    skyla -sweat angrybrow talkingmouth @talkingmouth "Well, if you thought that was impressive, you should hear what I'll drop on you in our second conversation!"
