calem @talking2mouth "So, [first_name] and I were discussing yesterday the issue of voter engagement. I think we can all agree that his poster campaign was the single most effective technique any of us has used during this process."

jasmine @talkingmouth "Yes, it was very well done. I hadn't heard of you before I saw your posters, but as soon as I did, I started asking everyone I knew if they knew you."
jasmine @happy "Leaving your name off the poster was a brilliant move."

red @closedbrow talking2mouth "That wasn't actually my set of posters. A couple of students who have beef with me put them up to try and mock me."

show cheren -surprisedbrow -frownmouth -surprised with dis

cheren shadow sad2eyes @sadmouth "I see."

calem @talkingmouth "In any case, if we want to increase voter turnout, then I think the solution is quite simple. We'll simply create a series of coordinated posters that state, in simple terms, what concrete benefits voting for us will give the voters."

calem @closedbrow talking2mouth "Voters simply won't get excited over values, or... {w=0.5}{nw}"
extend @sad "Well, anything intangible. The student population only cares about the {i}here{/i} and {i}now{/i}, so we need to tell them what we can give them {i}here{/i} and {i}now.{/i}"

grusha @sadbrow talking2mouth "Seems like a lot of work. We'll all get voted in, anyway, even without trying to raise awareness of the election. What's the point of bringing in more people who might vote against us?"

red @talkingmouth "Voter engagement is its own end."

calem @talkingmouth "True. Additionally, if we have any disagreements with the administration, then having a student body who is actually excited about our policies, and genuinely supports us, could give us a much-needed edge."
calem @closedbrow talking2mouth "We don't want to place ourselves in conflict with the administration, as they'd become defensive and block all our initiatives, but it doesn't hurt to have overwhelming popular support that would make their denial... {i}difficult.{/i}"

serena @talkingmouth "Brilliant, Calem. Watching you plan is like watching a painter at work."

red @talkingmouth "But he {i}is{/i} a painter, isn't he?"

serena @closedbrow talking2mouth "Yes. But watching him paint is like watching a dancer."

red @talkingmouth "Okay. But what's watching him dance like?"

serena @happy "Well, that's like--"

grusha @closedbrow talking2mouth "Can we {i}move on{/i}? Thanks."

calem @talkingmouth "Right. So I suggest that we simply go around the table and say what our number one goal for the student council is. If there are any repeats, then we'll sort that out."
calem @talking2mouth "Serena, why don't you go first? We'll go clockwise from you."

serena @closedbrow blush talkingmouth "Certainly. My position, as it always has been, is that we should have co-ed dorms."

calem @talkingmouth "...Right. Cheren?"

cheren @sadmouth "I suppose the repeal of the curfew is the only thing left for me."

calem @talkingmouth "Okay. My personal goal is to promote growth of Student Clubs. The clubs that exist right now are small and niche. Few people take them seriously."
calem @talkingmouth "The exception, of course, is the Battle Team. I dream of a Kobukan where every single club receives the same level of funding, attention, and champion-level guidance as the Battle Team."

jasmine @surprised "Do you think you could get other champions to be the advisors of the other clubs, then?"

calem @closedbrow talking2mouth "I can certainly try. Just imagine how many advantages future and current students of this school might have with direct tutelage from {i}even more{/i} champions."

calem @surprised "It's a pipe dream, but imagine if we could get the Contest Champion to lead the Coordinator's Club. These are the opportunities that Kobukan advertises itself as having--and so far, it's done brilliantly. But let's not let it rest."

grusha @talkingmouth "I dunno. Why would those high-profile people want to leave their jobs, unless they were forced to?"

calem @talkingmouth "Well, money helps. Hopefully, though, we'd be able to leverage favors, and negotiate small portions of their time."

serena @happy "Calem can absolutely do it. He has an unparalleled skill when it comes to forming connections."

cheren @sadmouth "This sounds like it'll raise the cost of tuition quite a bit more."

calem @talkingmouth "Probably, but Kobukan's already so restrictive, in terms of cost. What's just $1,500,000 more per student for the whole year?"

redmind @sad "Um... a lot..."

calem @closedbrow talking2mouth "The benefits will very much outweigh the costs, I believe. Now, Jasmine, your campaign?"

jasmine @talkingmouth "Expanded access and accomodations for disadvantaged students. Economically, mentally, or physically."

calem @happy "How noble. And Grusha?"
