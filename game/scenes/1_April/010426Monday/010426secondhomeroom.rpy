janine @talking2mouth closedbrow "Speaking of experience."

janine @talking2mouth "What levels are all your Pokémon right now? They should be around level 12. By the end of Sunday, you should have a team of level 14s."

blue @happy "Hah! All my Pokémon are {i}way{/i} higher levels than that!"

janine @talking2mouth "Good job."

pause 0.5

blue @surprised "What?"

janine @talking2mouth "I said good job, Blue. I hate repeating myself."

blue @surprised "But-- you-- I didn't... what?"

leaf @talking2mouth "What's [blue_name] stuttering about?"

red @closedbrow talking2mouth "I think this might be the first person who's ever actually said 'good job' to him."
red @happy "Probably doesn't know how to handle it!"

leaf @sadbrow talking2mouth "...Right."

janine @talking2mouth "I'll keep you updated on what levels your team should be at any given moment. [bluecolor]If you ever want a reminder, visit me in your free time in the Battle Hall.{/color}"

dawn @talkingmouth "Um... if we're below that level, where should we train?"

janine @talking2mouth "Besides the battles you have in class, the wild is an option."

hilbert @closedbrow talkingmouth "The Pokémon in the wild are all far too weak for me to care about. My Pokémon learn nothing from defeating them."

janine @closedbrow talking2mouth "Right. The school's almost done securing the forest after that fire, so I think you should probably be able to go into the forest soon."
janine @talking2mouth "The Pokémon there tend to be a bit stronger than the ones you might find in the city. Until the forest opens up, though, your best option is just to get in whatever practice you can on-campus."

janine @closedbrow talking2mouth "Speaking of. It's time we do some practice battles. Normally we'll do these every Friday, but I wanted to get a head start, since the first Quarter Qlash is soon."

bea @talking2mouth "You said you don't anticipate that we'll be matched up against anyone we cannot easily beat in the first Quarter Qlash."

janine @talking2mouth "That's right. I {i}don't{/i} anticipate that. Which is why we need to prepare for it."

red @surprisedeyebrows frownmouth "Intense."

janine @talking2mouth "Pair up. I want everyone to focus on training their Pokémon beneath level 12 right now."

janine @talking2mouth "[bluecolor]Battle Team training will always provide an extra boost to Pokémon beneath the recommended level.{/color}"

bea @talking2mouth "Are you going to assign partners?"

janine @talking2mouth "No. You'll eventually learn who your best training partner is. Until then, just pick someone."
