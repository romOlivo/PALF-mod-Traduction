calem @closedbrow talking2mouth "Well, Saturday afternoon, the former Student Council is going to host a round-table with everyone who wants to become part of the new Student Council."

red @talking2mouth "Uh-huh."

calem @closedbrow talking2mouth "Yes, that's a possibility. The Student Council asks that people remain at the Academy for the voting process, but the fact of the matter is that not a lot of Kobukan bothers to vote on their Student Council."
