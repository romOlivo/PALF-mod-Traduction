red @talking2mouth "Right. And you won't tell anyone else about...{w=0.5} {i}anything{/i} about me, right?"

oak @talkingmouth "Hm... not sure I can restrain myself, lad. I'm quite proud of you, you know. A Battle Team Member? A frontrunner in the student council election? An excellent student?"
oak @happy "How could I stop myself from talking about you?"

red @sadbrow happymouth "...Thanks, Sam. I just mean, don't tell anyone about... you know. Our private stuff."

red @confused "What? For saying 'good job?'"

leaf @sarcastic "Yeah, obviously I'm referring to that, and only that."

red @talking2mouth "How come you didn't tell me Tuesday, though?"

leaf -blush @surprised "Huh? I didn't find out until last night."

red @closedbrow talking2mouth "Oh, yeah... I guess maybe the invites went out in waves, then. It probably took Janine a while to box up all the rewards."

leaf @talkingmouth "Oh, I'm sure she has Battle Team minions for that."

red @happy "What do you think the Battle Team meeting will be about?"

leaf @closedbrow talking2mouth "Going to go out on a limb here and say we're probably going to battle."

red @surprised "Damn. The one thing I wasn't prepared for."

leaf blush @flirt "Well, shoot. Guess [blue_name] was right, and you're going to flunk out horribly."

red @closedbrow talking2mouth "It really do be like that."

leaf -blush @closedbrow talking2mouth "On a serious note, though, I hope they're going to tell us more about how the Quarter Qlashes work. And I want to know what part Janine's playing in this."
leaf @closedbrow talkingmouth "She's pretty badass, but I don't think she has any influence over how people in the QQs are matched up. She probably wants to avoid knocking out any of her own team, you know, but it's kinda unavoidable."

red @closedbrow talking2mouth "Right. I've got a few questions I want to ask about tournaments, personally."

leaf @surprised "Oh, I didn't even think about that! Good point."
leaf @happy "It'd be {i}so cool{/i} if we got to see how people from other regions battle."

red @confused "Wait, is there a difference?"

leaf @closedbrow talkingmouth "Are you serious?"

red @happy "Yep. 'Scuse my shelteredness."

leaf @happy "Yeah, there's tons of differences! People from Orre pretty much only do double battles. Unovan trainers love their Triple Battles." 
leaf @happy "And there's a new battle type from Paldea that's {i}really{/i} catching on called Squad Battles, that have entire teams of trainers facing each other! I heard the Academy is going to really push those this year."

leaf @sadbrow happymouth "Hey. It's alright. That's what we're here to learn, right?"

red @happy "Right. It's kinda fun to think about what Janine might be about to teach us, isn't it?"

leaf @happy "Totally! I bet she knows all kinds of battling tricks that we can't even begin to imagine."
leaf @closedbrow talkingmouth "...Like how her Venomoth had five moves. I didn't imagine that, right?"

red @surprised "You noticed, too? Yeah, that was the weirdest thing!"
