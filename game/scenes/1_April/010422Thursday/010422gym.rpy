alder norm @spunky2 "And that concludes the lecture! So, battle time. How has everyone been feeling about the double battle unit so far?"

misty uniform @talkingmouth "I don't get why we bother. All official battles are single battles. Aren't we just wasting time practicing double battles?"

alder @norm2 "Not at all. The skills are definitely transferrable, and Kobukan's own Quarter Qlashes have been in double, triple, and even inverse battle formats before."

misty @surprised "Inverse battles?"

alder @norm2 "Yep. A lot of Pokémon Leagues restrict Gym battles to one-versus-one affairs, but there are just as many out-of-the-Gym situations where knowing how to control multiple Pokémon at once can be useful."

alder @spunky2 "After all, when you're in the wild, Pokémon aren't likely to just line up one-on-one and fight you, all nicely."

alder @norm3 "Hm..."

alder @norm4 "Looks to me like a classic case of acting out for attention."

misty surprisedbrow frownmouth @surprised "Huh?"

alder @angry2 "Your Psyduck's actually very strong, so, clearly, you've been training him well. The issue, I think, is that the trainer-Pokémon relationship has more to it than just training."

red @confused "What's that, Sir?"

alder @happy2 "Oh, you already know, [first_name]. I've seen how you interact with your Pokémon."

alder @norm2 "Misty, you need to be more affectionate with your Psyduck. Right now, I'm willing to bet dollars to donuts that it feels underappreciated."

misty -surprisedbrow -frownmouth -surprised @talkingmouth "My Staryu isn't like that, though. And I train them the same way."

alder @sad2 "Well, just like with people, some Pokémon are more emotionally resilient. But just because they're better at hiding how they feel doesn't mean their feelings can be ignored."

misty @sad "I... I see."

alder @happy2 "The good news is, because your Psyduck is still acting out, that means it still cares about you. If it gave up, {i}then{/i} we'd have a problem." 
alder @norm2 "So as long as you make sure to groom it, take it out for non-training purposes, and let it know how important it is to you, we should be fine."

misty sad "...Right. {size=25}I just don't know...{/size}"
