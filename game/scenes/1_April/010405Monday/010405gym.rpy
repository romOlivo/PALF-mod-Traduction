bruno @talkingmouth "In addition to the exercise machines available, the gym also contains several battle simulators to allow students to experience what a live Pokémon match would feel like in real-time."
bruno @sadbrow talkingmouth "These are useful in case you wish to simulate battles outside of the realm of your own ability to train."
bruno @talkingmouth "On your own time, you may also hold battles here--genuine or simulated. Another place live battles may be fought is in the Battle Hall."
