alder @norm2 "It's also pretty common in other regions to ban evasion strategies, but it's a bit less common here."
alder @happy2 "Largely because Kobukan puts a lot more emphasis on non-single battles. Still, make sure you've got a team that can withstand any ruleset they throw at you!"

alder @norm2 "Of course. That's what I'm here for."

alder @spunky2 "Oh, you want her?"

alder @happy2 "Nah, nah. Sorry, just kidding."

may @talkingmouth "Oh, that makes more sense. Okay. I just wanted to know if you knew where I could get one."

alder @sad2 "Hm... well, this particular one came from an egg my {i}first{/i} Volcarona laid."

alder @norm4 "You'll definitely want to get a Larvesta. No offense, but I don't think anybody, save a Champion, should try to wrangle a Volcarona without a lot of trust built up. And the best way to do that is to raise it from an egg."

may @closedbrow sadmouth "Okay, okay... And this 'Larvesta,' I'm guessing it's Volcarona's pre-evolution?"

alder @norm2 "Right."

may @closedbrow talking2mouth "So where could I get a Larvesta egg?"

alder @sad "Hm{w=0.5}[ellipses]"

alder @spunky2 "Tell you what. Springsday's tomorrow, and that means the big Kobukan egg hunt is happening. I'll let you know that there'll be a Larvesta egg somewhere out there."

may @surprised "Really?"

alder @happy2 "Yep. And you'll know it's a Larvesta egg because it's very warm, and much bigger than the others. In fact, ancient Unovans used to keep Larvesta eggs in their houses, to warm them."

may @happy "Thanks, Sir!"

alder @norm2 "Well, if I'm giving out hints, would you like any?"

menu:
    "What's the best way to gather the most eggs?":
        alder @norm3 "Hm... just ignoring the other hunters and grabbing every egg you see, mostly. It's meant to be a fun community thing, but you can blow off the other hunters, if you want."

    "What kind of Pokémon are in the eggs?":
        alder @norm2 "Just baby Pokémon, that I know of. The kind of baby Pokémon that normally require incenses to get. These ones were bred in Paldea, though, so no incense required."

    "How can I tell what's in the eggs?":
        alder @norm2 "Oh, there's lots of different ways. Texture, weight, size, patterns. If you keep an eye on the egg's details, you should be able to figure out the Pokémon--or at least its type--pretty easily."

red @talkingmouth "Thanks for the advice, Sir. I'll take it to heart."
