hilda @surprised "Oh, [first_name]! Great, maybe you can help me figure this out."

red @talkingmouth "Sure, what's up?"

whitney @talking2mouth "Hilda was just asking me if I knew who the pineapple-haired guy hanging out with Hilbert all the time is."

red @confused "Pineapple-haired?"

hilda @talkingmouth "Yeah, Whitney told me his name is Nathan. So who {i}is{/i} this guy?"

redmind @thonk "{i}Nathan?{/i}"
red @talkingmouth "Um... he's just another student, as far as I know."

hilda @closedbrow talking2mouth "You're Hilbert's roommate. Do you know why he's spending time with someone else?"

whitney @angrybrow happymouth "Oh, are you jealous?"

hilda @surprised "What? No! I'm... shit, I dunno, concerned? Hilbert doesn't 'hang out' with people unless he's forced to."
hilda @sad "So, like, that must mean that Nate's got something on Hilbert, right? I'm just worried about what that is."

tia @talkingmouth "Is it a bad thing, if Hilbert spends time with other people?"

hilda @surprised "Huh? Well, no, I guess not. Hell, I've been trying to convince him to be more social for our entire lives."
hilda @closedbrow talkingmouth "But... you know, him suddenly finding a new best friend is concerning."
hilda @sad "There's... gotta be something that caused it, right?"

tia @talkingmouth "Maybe, but I don't think him finding a new friend is something you need to worry about."

red @talkingmouth "I agree. I just battled them in gym class, and they seemed fine enough. I kinda got the vibe they were working on some big secret."

red @confused "Is your birthday coming up?"

hilda @talkingmouth "Not for a long while. March 4th."

red @closedbrow talking2mouth "Beats me, then."

hilda @talkingmouth "Shit. Guess I just have to ask Hilbert, then. But I don't want him to think that I'm not {i}encouraging{/i} new friendships..."

whitney @talking2mouth "So... just out of curiosity, since I did that little favor for you, would you mind doing a favor for me?"

hilda @surprisedbrow frownmouth "Hm?"
hilda @happy "Shit, of course! What's up?"

whitney @happy "Go ahead, Tia."

tia lightblush sadbrow @happymouth "Um... my hat got ripped. Do you know how to repair it? My fingers aren't small enough..."

hilda @closedbrow talking2mouth "Your fingers? You've gotta have way smaller fingers than me, at your size. But, hell yeah, that'd be a piece of cake. Just a bit of darning."

tia @talkingmouth "Thank you!"

hilda @talkingmouth "No problem."

red @talkingmouth "Hey, how'd your hat get a rip, though? I've seen how carefully you take care of it. What happened?"

whitney @talking2mouth "It was the weirdest thing. We were just in Inspira, walking by the seaport, when--"

tia -lightblush @angrybrow frownmouth "I was in the city when this really big, bad, and angry person stole my hat!"

red @surprised "Again?"

whitney @surprisedmouth "Um, she said 'person,' but it was a Pokémon, wasn't it?"

tia sadbrow frownmouth @talkingmouth "...Yes. But Pokémon are people."

hilda @closedbrow talking2mouth "I mean... one of those Pokémon-rights organizations in Unova said that, but most people wouldn't agree."
hilda @sad "They ended up being terrorists, anyway."

tia @sad2brow talking2mouth "Does that mean... um... you don't think I'm a {i}person?{/i}"

whitney @surprised "What? No, of course you are, sweetie! You're a human!"

tia @sad2eyes happymouth "Hah! Of course. I'm a human. Hah hah."

whitney @happy "C'mon, Tee, you're probably lightheaded from all that running around you've been doing. Let's get you some fish."
