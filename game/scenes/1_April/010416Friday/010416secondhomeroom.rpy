oak @talkingmouth "...needless to say, laws regarding the necessity of proper accreditation when training and possessing Pokémon were quickly passed."
oak @talkingmouth "After unlicensed trainers became unable to possess Pokémon, the fledgling child trainer population dropped to essentially zero." 
oak @talkingmouth "Given these children now had nothing to do, and confiscating all their newly 'illegal' Pokémon would have been an act to inspire riots, schools were instead founded to hurry them through the licensing process."
oak @talkingmouth "Kobukan Academy, though many miles away, was founded by a group of teachers, businessmen, and translators employed by the Tokugawa Shogunate, answering Kobukan's request for instruction."
oak "Indeed! Kobukan Academy is the {i}direct{/i} educational descendant of those licensing schools."
oak @talkingmouth "Some say the emperor's response to what was an isolated, if heartbreaking, tragedy was heavy-handed, but at the same time, our Pokémon-focused world nowadays is a direct result of his decisiveness."
oak "After all--can you imagine a world where children would be permitted to go out into the wild with Pokémon, and no education or training? What a scary thought!"

janine @surprised "You fought an Absol? Huh. Anyway, yeah, exactly."

janine @sad "Most of your opponents will be using Pokémon around level 20 or so, before the strength equalizer. Expect to see a few evolved Pokémon. And, uh..."
janine @talking2mouth "Your biggest advantage? That your Pokémon listen to you right away? Expect that to go away. Around level fifteen is when trainers can start commanding their Pokémon properly."

janine @talking2mouth "Yeah."
