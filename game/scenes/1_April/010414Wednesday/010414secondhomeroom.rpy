oak @talkingmouth "...So, it's important to remember that Pokémon seem to have an innate desire toward cooperation." 
oak @talkingmouth "There are exceptions in both directions, of course, such as the incredibly cooperative Passimian, or endlessly {i}un{/i}cooperative Zweilous."
oak @talkingmouth "Still, a wild Pokémon that asks another wild Pokémon to assist is likely to receive its desired assistance."
oak @talkingmouth "Perhaps it's the universality of the Pokémon 'language'? Or perhaps Pokémon simply do not regard each other with suspicion, as humans do?"
oak @talkingmouth "The answer to this is unlikely to be learned during my lifetime."

leaf @sarcastic "You ever notice that Oak leaves a lot of his questions really open-ended?"

red uniform @talkingmouth "Well, that's science, I guess. Awesome if we can find hard answers, but most of the time, the scientists' job is just asking questions."

leaf @sarcastic "Maybe if you're a {i}lame{/i} scientist. If you're an awesome one, you just resurrect fossils and drown in boatloads of cash."

red @closedbrow talking2mouth "I can't imagine your clientele is too expansive in that field?"

leaf @happy "Nah, but those who {i}can{/i} pay will pay out the nose for it."

leaf sadbrow frownmouth "Oh no... that's so sad!"

red @sadeyes sadeyebrows talkingmouth "I think that Bianca's just really running Whitney ragged. As soon as she gets used to her new schedule, I'm sure she'll have time to do fun stuff like that again."
